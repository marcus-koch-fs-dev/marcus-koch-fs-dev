# Hi, I'm Marcus üëã

I started my career in **automotive validation & test engineering**, working close to hardware with LabVIEW, CANoe and environmental test labs.  
After several years in China and Germany, I made a **career change into software development** through an intensive MERN bootcamp and hands-on projects.  

Today I work as a **Full-Stack Developer**, building applications with **React, Node.js and modern web technologies**.  
My long-term ambition is to combine **E-Commerce, IoT and sports**, turning ideas into digital products and maybe businesses.
